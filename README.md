This is a little mock project I put together in 2022 to practice full-stack skills and see how it would fit together in a real, functioning application. It was created using Mongo and Node.js (with Express) on the backend, with HTML/CSS/Javascript on the front end.

There are a number of features this project contains, namely;
1. CRUD operations for account creation, reviews, shopping cart functionality and post management.
2. User accounts with email verification (via NodeMailer), shopping cart functionality and order history. Email verification is required for posting reviews.
3. Payment processing system via PayPal.
4. A fully functional administrative backend that lets you manage each posting and its details (i.e., item name, price, attached images), as well as view completed orders.
5. Beautiful modals for each posting that allows you to quickly view an item and add it to cart.
Alongside many other features.

If you get the chance, check it out!

P.S. - You will never receive anything you purchase on this website, as it's a portfolio project!
